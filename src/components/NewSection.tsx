          While scouting for the right college it is easy to get distracted with
          all the information out there and it gets harder to find the right
          fit. In such a scenario, the experience of senior students who have
          already gone through the labyrinth of the university admissions can
          prove to be invaluable. They can direct you in the right direction by
          pointing out the loopholes and realities the luring college admission
          sites wonâ€™t mention. Having a rough idea of how exactly your college
          life looks like can make your first day feel like a breeze than
          overload of information. Thus, understanding the importance of mentors
          while making your decision, this platform is developed by students to
          help their fellow students find the right path and make their journey
          meaningful.
